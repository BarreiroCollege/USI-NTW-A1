                        Kodular is an online platform which enables anyone to <strong> build Android apps without
                        writing a single line of code</strong>. It started in 2017 as a part-time project with other
                        high-school students from around the globe (Netherlands, UK, Germany, India and Spain) to
                        experiment and learn new things on our own. But it grew so fast that we opened a company in
                        the Netherlands to handle all the resources. And finally, in 2019, <strong>we migrated it to
                        the United States and I took over the company as CEO</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of now, Kodular has nearly 1 million registered developers, with over 2.5 million app
                        projects. And within those apps, more than 2 million people are using those apps every day.

                        I am an active member of Civil Defense (<i>Protecci√≥n Civil</i>) in my city since 2017. I
                        joined as part of the International Baccalaureate, as we had to do volunteering to get the
                        Diploma. However, after finishing the Baccalaureate, I liked the work we were doing that I
                        decided to stay to become a full volunteer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our responsibilities is taking care of emergencies that happen in our region. Though, most of
                        the time, our roles is basically help and support police officers, firefighters and emergency
                        medical technicians. We are taught skills in all these three roles to support people in events
                        or crowded places. For example, I coordinated the fireworks of the great day of the city
                        these last two years, which definitely shows how much time and effort is put into these kind
                        of events that most people are not aware of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the pandemic, our work became even more important. So, with another volunteer that
                        studied informatics as well, we decided to improve Civil Defense and <strong>created an internal
                        platform to manage all operations and resources</strong> (as everything was being done in
                        paper), as well as <strong><a href="https://proteccioncivil.sdc.gal" target="_blank">a public
                        website</a></strong> so people can get to know us better.

                        I learned to code back in 2014, but it was not with a "real" programming language. I started
                        with MIT App Inventor, which is the original project from which Kodular originates. Then, I
                        kept learning on my own, and eventually a few years later I started making contributions to
                        their source code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After several contributions, <strong>I was able to join the team as contributor</strong>. And
                        in 2019, I attended the Summit to meet the rest of the team at MIT, as well as other former
                        team members from Google (the original project started at Google, but MIT took over it). And
                        in 2020, I went with other contributors to Brussels to showcase the project at FOSDEM, just a
                        few months before the pandemic started.

                        During Summer 2020, I have been working as Student Intern for the project as part of the
                        <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> program. My project was to first implement a new
                        compiler for projects (basically, Android apps are packaged as APK files, but Google recently
                        introduced the new AAB format for Google Play Store). And once finishing with that project,
                        I started a full in-depth refactor of the compiler to modularize it. The final report can be
