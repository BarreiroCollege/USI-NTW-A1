        <h3><u>Personal Info</u></h3>
        <p id="main-text">
            My name is Aristeidis. I am from Ioannina, Greece and I am currently studying Informatics at USI as an exchange student.
            I started doing my bachelor at the <a href="https://www.cs.uoi.gr/?lang=en">University of Ioannina</a> since 2017, I am at the end
            of my studies and I wanted to do my last semester in Switzerland. 
        </p>

        <h3><u>Why Informatics</u></h3>

        <p id="main-text">
            I remember myself since a very young age attracted to computers. I used to play a lot of video games and spending
            hours in front of a screen. During my early education I always liked math, until I randomly discovered computer programming.
            The first moment I interacted with that, it instantly grabbed my serious attention, and I knew that this is my future.
