        <h3><u>My City</u></h3>
        <p id="main-text">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannina">Ioannina</a> is the city where I was born and raised. It is located

        <h3><u>Why Informatics</u></h3>

        <p id="main-text">
            I remember myself since a very young age attracted to computers. I used to play video games and spending
            hours in front of a screen. During my early education I always liked math, until I randomly discovered computer programming.
            The first moment I interacted with that, it instantly grabbed my serious attention, and I felt that this is my future.
