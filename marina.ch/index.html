            My name is Marina Papageorgiou, I am 21 years old. I was born at 4th of February in 2001. I am an Erasmus student for this Spring Semester of 2022 at 
            Università della Svizzera italiana (USI). Generally, I am studying in Greece, at University of Ioannina (UOI) in the department of computer science and engineering. I am also from Ioannina, the city that I grow up and studying.
           
           I have chosen Lugano as an Erasmus destination for numerous reasons. First of all, Switzerland is in the center of Europe and there are opportunities that may not even exist in other Countries and cities. Moreover, Lugano is very beautiful city and a dreamy destination that everyone can visit. The landscapes and especially the mountains and the unique lake are attractive to tourists.
           Also, the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) is very well organized and every single student would love to study there. The professors are excited of the subject, which they deal with and they are trying to teach the students in an experimental way the new knowledge. The places are very neat and clean. There seems to be organization and respect from both teachers and students. Last but not least, the subjects are very interesting and the the curriculum is very correct, specifically the courses are interconnected and one helps to learn the other. Finally, the teaching material of the courses is enriched and in this way the course becomes more contagious and interesting for the students. They are not bored, on the contrary they are enthusiastic and anxious about the lesson.
           
           In my free time I like playing volleyball and taking dancing courses. I am playing volleyball since I was 8 years old and I am taking dancing courses since I was 3 years old. In addition, I have tried many sports but finally I ended up at those two. I choose volleyball because I had a motivation and a goal to win something (prizes the most of the times). Αlso, I was playing volleyball at the Greek’s national team. Moreover, I has chosen ballet because I was very stressed due to the school and the assignments that I had to do and ballet made me calm and forget all those “boring” things for me.
           
           Additionally, was used in playing piano and guitar, because I love classic music. My teachers also were really good and they helped me a lot in my music career.
